24V Supply Failure ! (not software handled)


Cooling Pressure Low
    -Indicated Leakage
    -Detect Low for time (watchdog timeout)
    -error propaged by BECU to SECU to state-maschine

Cooling Pressure Hight
    -Indicate Busting of pipes.
    -Detect Low for time (watchdog timeout)
    -error propaged by BECU to SECU to state-maschine

MDB Error 
    -Distance Sensor Error || Distance Sensor Out Of Range
        -React immediatly (handle in mdbs)
    -Precharge Failure (not possible to detect)
    -error propaged by CLU to SECU to state-maschine
    -special case: MDB OverTemperature (set require cooling)

Telemetry Timeout
    -Setup Periodic Signal from Canoe (required in idle to continue)
    -throw error on timeout.
    -implies two way communication because of TCP.
    -handle in SECU directly forward to state-maschine

44V BMS Error
    - Health Status Low
    - Voltage to Low.
    - Voltage to High.
    - Cell Imbalance
    - Over Temperature
    - Over Current
    - Directly forward to state-maschine.


BIR / SDC Failure (not software handled)

Brake Solenoid Failure (not software handled)

Track Solendoid Failure (not software hanlded)

Position estimation inconsistant
    -Fiducial Range check 
    -on Failure stop immediatly.

Healthbeat miss (optional)

Track pneumatic overpressure
    -don't push
    -propage to ground station -> SECU -> state-machine  (weak handling)

Track pneumatic underpressure 
    -don't push
    -propage to ground station -> SECU -> state-machine  (weak handling)


ECU OnBoard Over temperature (optional)

EBox Over Temperature (optional)
